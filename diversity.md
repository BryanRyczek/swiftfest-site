Diversity is essential to a successful SwiftFest Boston 2018. Everyone from volunteers to speakers to organizers have a shared goal of bringing people from underrepresented communities to SwiftFest Boston 2018. We hope to provide a great conference experience for everyone regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, national origin, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technological choices or experience.

With the help of our generous sponsors SwiftFest Boston 2018 has resources to provide scholarships and stipends for travel-related expenses. If you are an aspiring SwiftFest Boston 2018 attendee requiring financial or logistical assistance then we want to hear from you!

The form is simple and private to SwiftFest Boston 2018 organizers. We will accept submissions until May 31, 2018.
