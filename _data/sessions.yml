  title: "The Simple Layout of a Complex Interface"
  description: |
   Understanding Auto Layout is your best chance to write UI code you can be proud of. Its power often underestimated, its features easily misused, I find it overall less appreciated than it could be, if more widely understood.

   This talk is aiming to show how relying heavily on Auto Layout makes you move faster and be more confident writing UI code. Working with the safe area, showing off custom UILayoutGuides and making use of the controversal UIStackViews, we will walk through the simple code of a more complex interface together.
  outcome: |
   - How to express layout fast and simple, without touching Interface Builder
   - How Auto Layout helps to reduce state in your views / view controllers
   - Why the safe area is great and how to rely on it without knowing what device your code is running on
   - When to use custom UILayoutGuides and how they help to avoid using numeric values all around
   - UIStackViews: why they are great, but controversial. How to work with stack views in scrollable layouts

  title: "Collaboration by Design! “What’chu talkin’ ‘bout, Willis?”"
  description: |
   A lot of developers are quick to say that designers should learn to develop. To me, being able to design is an important skill to have as a developer. We all know that there is a significant divide when it comes to designers and developers. This split limits us to be better developers because sometimes we do not want to see the other side of things. Sometimes we as developers do not understand the designer's point of view. Developers and designers have different specialties that we can leverage from each other.

   In this talk, I will discuss the different specialties we can take advantage of from both sides. Additionally, I will cover why you should start picking your designer's brain today. Finally, I will discuss how to get started and what tools designers are using today for doing wireframes to iOS app designs.

  title: "Story of 2 indie devs, 1M+ annual revenue"
  description: |
   My talk will tell our 3 year story as a 2 person independent developer team making the two popular photo and video editing apps Typorama and Videorama, reaching 6M downloads worldwide, generating 1M+ annual revenue on the App Store. I’ll be talking about both the technical and the business tactics and strategies we used to drive downloads and create products loved and used by millions.
  outcome: |
   Learning and using the latest programming technologies and trends is cool, but if you combine that with a business and marketing know-how, developers have a huge potential in their hands to create super profitable micro businesses just on their own. Making a living off the App Store is getting harder each day, and I’ll help the audience learn how to hack their way to success.
